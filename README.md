# 100-day-coding-challenge

My medium post explaining the challenge: https://medium.com/@alberthu/my-100-day-coding-challenge-1cfc0985b1e5

100 days, 100 computer science interview questions. The questions can range from topics that I'm good at,
topics that I know nothing about, different websites like leetcode, geeksforgeeks,
interviewcake, codefights, or different Facebook groups I'm a part of. I'll
brainstorm solutions, write some code, and discuss tradeoffs. The point is to show
up every day and **just do it**.

Challenges by day:  
[Day 1](./day1) - Design and implement a MinStack  
[Day 2](./day2) - Return a random node from a linked list
